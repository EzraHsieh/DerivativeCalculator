# Derivative Calculator

Author: Ezra Hsieh

## Acknowledgment
This program was inspired by the Calculus with Python lectures delivered by Dr. Joseph Cutrone of Johns Hopkins University.

## Description

This is a simple Python program for calculating derivatives of mathematical functions. By utilizing the `sympy` library, the program allows you to input a function and the variable with respect to which you want to differentiate. It then computes and displays the derivative of the function.

## Features

- Supports differentiation of a wide range of mathematical functions.
- Interactive user interface prompts for function and variable inputs.
- Automatically plots the derived function using `matplotlib`.
- Provides the option to continue with another function or exit the program.

## Requirements

To run the program, make sure you have `sympy` and `matplotlib` libraries installed. You can install them using `pip` with the following command:

```
pip install sympy matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `derivative_calculator.py` file.

2. Make sure you have Python and the required libraries installed.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `derivative_calculator.py` file is located.

4. Run the program by executing the following command:

   ```
   python derivative_calculator.py
   ```

5. Follow the instructions provided by the program to enter the function and variable for differentiation.

6. The program will calculate the derivative, display the result, and plot the derived function using `matplotlib`.

7. You will be prompted to enter whether you want to perform another differentiation or exit the program.

Feel free to explore and experiment with various functions and variables to observe their derivatives.
